# AwesomeTx

The prosperities of DeFi and web3, in a large part, should be attributed to the powerful Smart Contract. Its composability releases the huge potential of human creation for fortune. On the other hand, the following complexity involving mutliple chains, protocols, liquidity pools, and unknown entities has been confusing for most of the web3 users, which has been hampering the transparency in the community, thus increasing the systematic risks for the web3 world.

To help the public have deeper understanding of the interaction among all those elements in Smart Contracts, we'd like to invite you to submit the transactions you found either amazing, rare, or hard to deciper. We will regularly select the most intriguing ones, analyze them, and release the reports.
